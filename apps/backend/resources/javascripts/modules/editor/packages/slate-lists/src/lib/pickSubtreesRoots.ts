 * Will return a minimal subset of the given nodes that includes the rest of the given nodes as descendants.

 *  A11      A31       B31
 *
 * A is the subtree root that includes every other node:

 * A and B1 are the subtree roots that include every other node:

 * A, B1, B2, and B3 are the subtree roots that include every other node:
 * - pickSubtreesRoots([A, A1, A2, A3, A31, B1, B2, B3, B31]) === [A, B1, B2, B3]
